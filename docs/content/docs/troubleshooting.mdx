## General Issues

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Layout is not correct">
You can try to use the `drawDebugBorder` option to draw a border around the nodes.

```tsx
import { ImageResponse } from "@takumi-rs/image-response";

export function GET() {
  return new ImageResponse(<></>, {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    drawDebugBorder: true,
    // ...
  });
}
```

If the issue still exists, please file an issue on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/kane50613/takumi/issues).

## Node.js Related issues

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Cannot find native binding.">
This happens when `@takumi-rs/core` package failed to find the native binding. Make sure you have finished the [Additional Bundler Setup](/docs/index#additional-bundler-setup) step.
