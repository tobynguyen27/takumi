Takumi is an **image rendering engine** written in Rust that provides [various integrations](/docs/integrations). The design is mainly inspired by [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), but with a focus on portability and performance.

You can experience Takumi in [Playground](/playground) without any installation.

## Installation

The fastest/simplest way to use Takumi is with the `ImageResponse` wrapper, it manages the internal state for font & image cache.

```npm
npm i @takumi-rs/image-response @takumi-rs/helpers @takumi-rs/core
```

## Usage

Since `ImageResponse` extends standard [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) class, you can plug it into anywhere you want.

It comes with pre-bundled [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) and Geist Mono as default fonts (OFL License).

```tsx
import ImageResponse from "@takumi-rs/image-response";
import { serve } from "bun";

serve({
  fetch() {
    return new ImageResponse(<div tw="text-2xl bg-white w-full h-full grid place-items-center">Hello</div>, {
      width: 1200,
      height: 630,
      format: "webp",
    });
  }
});
```

For detailed framework/runtime integration guide, check the [Integrations](/docs/integrations) category.

### Why build a satori alternative?

Takumi's focus is on how to rasterize images fast, while satori outputs SVG.

- All in one. No need to output SVG then have [resvg-js](https://github.com/thx/resvg-js) rendering it again to output PNG.
- Inline layout support (display `block` or `inline`).
- RTL support.
- Variable fonts support.
- WOFF2 font format support.
- PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF output support.
- WebP, APNG animation rendering support.
