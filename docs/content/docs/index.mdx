Takumi is an **image rendering engine** written in Rust that provides bindings for Node.js and WebAssembly. Suitable for high-throughput image rendering workloads such as Open Graph images and Twitter images.

The design is mainly inspired by [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), but with a focus on portability and performance.

## Why build a satori alternative?

Takumi's focus is on how to rasterize images fast, while satori focuses on SVG output.

I'm not saying you should just use Takumi everywhere, there are places where SVG output could be a better fit. Pick the right tool for the job.

- All in one. No need to output SVG then have [resvg-js](https://github.com/thx/resvg-js) rendering it again to output PNG.
- Inline layout support (display `block` or `inline`).
- RTL support.
- Variable fonts support.
- WOFF2 font format support.
- PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF output support.
- WebP, APNG animation rendering support.

## Goals

- Takes your existing JSX components and drops them in, it should just work.
- Minimal binary size targets to run everywhere.
- Be the go-to library for image/animation rendering.
- Have a great developer experience.
